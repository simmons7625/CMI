## Target Classes (18 gestures)

### Target Behaviors (8 classes)
Behaviors of primary interest for detection:
1. `Above ear - pull hair`
2. `Cheek - pinch skin`
3. `Eyebrow - pull hair`
4. `Eyelash - pull hair`
5. `Forehead - pull hairline`
6. `Forehead - scratch`
7. `Neck - pinch skin`
8. `Neck - scratch`

### Non-Target Behaviors (10 classes)
Control behaviors for comparison:
1. `Text on phone`
2. `Wave hello`
3. `Write name in air`
4. `Pull air toward your face`
5. `Feel around in tray and pull out an object`
6. `Glasses on/off`
7. `Drink from bottle/cup`
8. `Scratch knee/leg skin`
9. `Write name on leg`
10. `Pinch knee/leg skin`

## Data Characteristics

### Missing Values
- Missing sensor readings are represented as `-1.0`
- Common in Time-of-Flight sensor arrays when sensors are out of range
- Requires careful handling in preprocessing

### Sequence Structure
- Each `sequence_id` represents one complete gesture instance
- Sequences have **variable lengths** (different number of time steps)
- Data is temporally ordered within sequences via `sequence_counter`

### Data Distribution
- Multiple sequences per subject across different gestures
- Balanced representation of target vs non-target behaviors
- Various orientations and phases captured per gesture

## Technical Specifications

### Sensor Technology
- **Accelerometer:** Measures linear acceleration in 3D space
- **Gyroscope:** Measures rotational movement (quaternion format)
- **Thermal Sensors:** Capture temperature variations (5 sensors)
- **Time-of-Flight (ToF):** Distance measurements using light (5 sensors Ã— 64 measurements each)

### Sampling and Timing
- Time-series data with regular sampling intervals
- Sequential measurements within each gesture sequence
- Multiple phases captured per gesture (transition, execution, etc.)

### Coordinate Systems
- Accelerometer: Standard 3D Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)
- Gyroscope: Quaternion representation (w, x, y, z) for rotation
- ToF sensors: Distance measurements in sensor-specific coordinate frames

## Data Quality Considerations

### Challenges for Modeling
1. **Variable sequence lengths** - Requires padding or dynamic length handling
2. **Missing values (-1.0)** - Need imputation or masking strategies  
3. **High dimensionality** - 339 features require dimensionality reduction or feature selection
4. **Multimodal fusion** - Different sensor types need appropriate combination
5. **Subject variability** - Individual differences in gesture execution

### Preprocessing Recommendations
1. **Handle missing values:** Imputation, masking, or exclusion strategies
2. **Sequence alignment:** Padding/truncation for fixed-length models
3. **Feature scaling:** Normalize different sensor modalities appropriately
4. **Temporal smoothing:** Apply filtering to reduce sensor noise
5. **Feature engineering:** Extract statistical and spectral features from raw signals

## Evaluation Approach

**Submission Format:**
- One prediction per `sequence_id` in test data
- Must match exact gesture strings from the 18 target classes
- Evaluated using classification metrics (likely accuracy or F1-score)

**Local Testing:**
- Use provided `CMIGateway` evaluation framework
- Simulates competition evaluation environment
- Processes sequences individually with timeout constraints
